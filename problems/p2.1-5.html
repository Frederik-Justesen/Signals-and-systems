<h1>Problem 2.1-5</h1>
<p>
    $\textbf{Question}:\\$ Determine the power of the signal $g(t)$. Also find the power and rms values of $(\textbf{a}) \: -g(t)$, $(\textbf{b}) \: 1.5g(t)$, $(\textbf{c}) \: g(-t)$, and $(\textbf{d}) \: g(1.5t)$.

    $\textbf{Answer}:\\$
    Because $g(t)$ is periodic with period $T=4$ we need only consider the interval $0$ to $4$ to find the average power. Moreover, because the function is squared in the power calculation process,
    we need not worry about the sign of $g(t)$. This means we can mirror the negative part of $g(t)$ in the x-axis and get the same result as if we hadn't.

    The mirrored version is clearly an even function (assuming period of $4$), hence the power of $g(t)$ becomes
    $$ \begin{align}P_g &= \frac{1}{4} \int_0^4 g^2(t) \: \text{d}t = \frac{2}{4}\int_0^2 \big(t^3\big)^2 \: \text{d}t \\\\ 
    &= \frac{2^7}{2\cdot 7} = \frac{64}{7}\end{align}$$

    For $(\textbf{a})$, we recognize that because the sign doesn't matter 
    $$P_{-g} = P_g = \frac{64}{7} $$
    The rms value
    $$g_\text{rms} = \sqrt{P_g} = 3.02$$

    For $(\textbf{b})$, the integral is simply the same as for $g(t)$, now simply scaled by $1.5^2$
    $$P_{1.5g} = \frac{2}{4}\int_0^2 \big(1.5t^3\big)^2 \: \text{d}t = 1.5^2 \cdot  \frac{2^7}{2\cdot 7} = 20.571 $$
    The rms value
    $$(1.5g)_\text{rms} = \sqrt{P_{1.5g}} = 4.53$$

    For $(\textbf{c})$, time-inversion obviously does not affect the power because $g(-t) = (-t)^3$, but $g^2(-t) = \big((-t)^3\big)^2 = t^6$.
    The integration limits do change to $-4$ (lower) and $0$ (upper) but the power remains the same as in $(\textbf{a})$, as the signal is periodic.
    The rms value also remains the same as in $(\textbf{a})$.

    For $(\textbf{d})$, time scaling does affect the $\textbf{energy}$ of the signal, but not the power. This is because the integration limits change, so the result from the energy integral changes.
    But in the power calculation, the period also changes along with the scaling factor in front of the integral, cancelling out the effect of the altered integration limits.
    $$ \begin{align}P_{g_{(1.5t)}} &= \frac{2}{4/1.5}\int_0^{2/1.5}\Big([1.5t]^3 \Big)^2 \: \text{d}t \\\\
    &= 1.5^6\frac{2}{2.66}\int_0^{2/1.5} t^6 \: \text{d}t \\\\
    &= \frac{64}{7} \end{align}$$
    The rms value
    $$g(1.5t)_\text{rms} = \sqrt{P_{g(1.5t)}} = 3.02$$
