    When routing a PCB for EMC purposes the stackup should generally follow the rule, that adjacent to a signal layer, there must be 
    a return reference plane (power or GND plane). It is really preferable that the return reference plane be unobstructed such that the return path is as close to the 
    signal trace as possible. A good example of a stackup is signal-gnd-gnd-signal. Here, the traces on the signal layers have an adjacent return reference plane. 
    A bad stackup would be signal-signal-gnd-signal, because a trace on layer 1 has to couple to layer 3 via stray capacitances, causing a huge current loop
    radiating a lot of electric and magnetic fields. Especially bad, is that the electric fields coupling to layer 3 will have to pass through layer 2 causing
    a small AC displacement current to flow through nets and copper pours. This uncontrolled displacement current flows to ground in whatever ways it can - not necessarily symmetrically.

    When a trace changes layers, the return current must also “via” to the new reference plane. 
    Provide nearby ground stitching vias (or a stitching cap if changing to a power plane) tight to the signal via.

    The adjacent return reference planes should be close to the signal layers, and far away from other return reference planes, to avoid capacitive coupling.
    Return reference plane should never have slots or cuts in them.

    When connecting sitching vias between copper pours and ground planes, avoid isolated islands that create antenna patterns. The copper pours should be connected to each other,
    otherwise don't use pours in sections that create small isolated antenna structures.

    When routing signals, don't change the width of the traces if they carry high frequency currents. A change in impedance will result in a discontinuity causing a reflection to occur.
    
    Keep traces a certain distance away from each other to avoid cross talk. Also avoid long traces to prevent signal degradation from happening.
