    When routing a PCB for EMC purposes the stackup should generally follow the rule, that adjacent to a signal layer, there must be 
    a return reference plane (power or GND plane). It is really preferable that the return reference plane be unobstructed such that the return path is as close to the 
    signal trace as possible. A good example of a stackup is signal-gnd-gnd-signal. Here, the traces on the signal layers have an adjacent return reference plane. 
    A bad stackup would be signal-signal-gnd-signal, because a trace on layer 1 has to couple to layer 3 via stray capacitances, causing a huge current loop
    radiating a lot of electric and magnetic fields. Especially bad, is that the electric fields coupling to layer 3 will have to pass through layer 2 causing
    a displacement current to flow through nets and copper pours. 

    When a trace changes layers, the return current must also “via” to the new reference plane. 
    Provide nearby ground stitching vias (or a stitching cap if changing to a power plane) tight to the signal via
